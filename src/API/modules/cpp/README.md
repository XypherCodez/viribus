Please only use up-to-date modules and secure modules.

We don't have any modules blacklisted, so don't make us do that.

When adding the files, DO NOT:
    - Add it to be run by default,
    - Remove other sections that were written by other users,
    - Attempt to add ANY support AT ALL for the private API.

If possible, please try to add support for other package managers.
